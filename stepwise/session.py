"""One run of one procedure: the join between the tracker and the checker.

The online path of plan section 4.5, minus perception. A `Session` owns a state
model and a checker and does the two things neither can do alone:

*Drains events.* The tracker reports what changed; the checker judges it.

*Closes the re-verification loop* (FR-CHK-7, FR-STA-6). The checker defers a
judgement and asks for a second look; the tracker says when its view is clear;
and deciding *which* steps that second look confirmed needs the spec, which
only the session has. This is the one place the three meet, and keeping it here
is why the tracker stays reusable for another procedure (NFR-MNT-1) and the
checker stays free of grid geometry.

*Assembles moves.* A lattice reports slot changes, but a Jenga rule judges a
move; the pairer that joins the halves sits between the two (see
`rules_jenga.MovePairer`).

Perception plugs in above: call the tracker's own `observe` with each frame's
detections, then `pump` to get the alerts. Nothing here touches a camera, so a
whole session can be replayed from a script -- see `stepwise/replay.py`.
