"""The world-state interface (FR-STA-1, NFR-MNT-2).

One interface, two implementations: `state/lego/` keeps a stud grid and
`state/jenga/` keeps a tower lattice. The checker holds a `WorldState` and never
asks which it has, which is the whole of FR-STA-1. Adding a third state model
must require implementing this class and nothing else (NFR-MNT-2), so anything
procedure-specific that leaks in here is a bug in the design, not a shortcut.

A tracker's job is to *observe*, not to simulate. Nothing in the system applies
a spec's declared effects to the state -- the state is whatever the cameras last
confirmed. That is why a hard-dependency violation means our reading is wrong
(FR-CHK-7) rather than that the world is inconsistent.
