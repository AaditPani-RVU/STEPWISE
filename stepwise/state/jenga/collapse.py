"""Collapse detection (FR-STA-8).

A collapse is the one Jenga event the lattice cannot express -- there is no
occupancy grid for a heap -- and the one that ends the session. It is detected
from the tower's measured height, which the side views give directly: normal
play moves the top by at most one layer at a time, while a collapse takes it
down by many layers inside a single frame. The two are separated by an order of
magnitude, which is why the plan calls this trivially separable.

Two guards keep it from firing on a bad frame rather than a fallen tower:

*The reference height is a median* of the last few frames, so a single glitchy
reading cannot become the "before" a later frame is compared with.

*The drop must hold* for `confirm_frames` consecutive frames. A silhouette
briefly cut short -- a hand across the view, a dropped frame -- recovers on the
next one; a fallen tower does not. The collapse is timestamped at the first
low frame, not the confirming one, so the report's reconstruction of the last
moves is anchored to when it actually happened.
