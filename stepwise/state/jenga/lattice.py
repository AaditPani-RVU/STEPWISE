"""The Jenga tower lattice (FR-STA-7, FR-STA-8).

An occupancy grid of `layers x slots_per_layer`, plus the alternating layer
orientation, which is structural rather than observed. Two orthogonal side
cameras give full observability -- every layer is end-on to exactly one view, so
its gaps are directly visible (plan 2.2) -- and this class is what they write
into. Deriving the grid from those views is `perception/`'s job; everything here
is pure state, which is why a Jenga failure is attributable to reasoning rather
than to detection (plan 1.1).

**Preconditions are judged against the state before the move.** This is the one
subtle thing in the file. The tracker freezes while hands occlude the workspace
and updates once they leave, so by the time a move reaches the checker the
tower has already changed. Evaluating "finish a layer before starting the next"
against the *new* state would clear every violation of it: placing the first
block of a fresh layer makes that layer the top layer, so `dst.layer ==
top_layer` becomes true precisely because the illegal move happened. So
`predicates()` binds the tower as it stood before the move, and
`collapse_detected` -- which is about now, not before -- is the sole exception.

"Before the move" is not always "the previous reading". A player deliberates
with the block in hand, so the pull and the placement usually land in separate
readings, and the reading between them shows a tower with a gap and nothing on
top. Judging the placement against that would bill one illegal pull as three
fouls. So the baseline only advances from a reading with no block in hand --
one holding at least as many blocks as the baseline did.
