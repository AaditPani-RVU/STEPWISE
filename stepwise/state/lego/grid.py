"""Stud-grid geometry (FR-CAL-*, FR-STA-2).

Everything about turning what the camera saw into stud coordinates, and about
what two poses on a stud grid mean relative to each other. Deliberately has no
dependency on OpenCV: `perception/calibrate.py` produces the homography, this
module only applies it, so the geometry is testable with a matrix literal and no
camera.

Stud coordinates are continuous here and integral in a `Pose`. The gap between
them is the `residual`, which is the detector metric plan section 7 actually
cares about -- median centroid error <= 0.4 stud, p95 <= 1.0 -- because mAP@0.5
on a 2x4 brick allows roughly a full stud of slack and a "passing" detection can
still trip a wrong-position alert.
