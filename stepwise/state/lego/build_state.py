"""The LEGO build-state tracker (FR-STA-2, FR-STA-3, FR-STA-4, FR-STA-6).

Holds the model as placed bricks in stud coordinates and turns changes between
readings into `ADD` and `REMOVE` events. Two things guard it against the failure
mode that dominates this workspace -- a hand over the plate:

*Freeze while occluded* (FR-PER-6). A reading taken with a hand across the
baseplate is not a weak reading, it is a wrong one: bricks behind the hand simply
are not there as far as the detector is concerned. So nothing is committed while
hands are present, and the stability timers restart when they leave.

*Commit only what has held still* (FR-STA-3). Each cell has its own timer, in
both directions: a brick must be seen continuously for `stable_s` before it is
placed, and missing continuously for `stable_s` before it is removed. Per-cell
rather than whole-scene, so one flickering detection in a corner cannot stall
every other commit.

The tracker knows nothing about steps or about the procedure. It reports what is
on the plate; the checker decides whether that is correct.
