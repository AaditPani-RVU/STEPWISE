"""Matching and alert text for the tower lattice (FR-CHK-10).

Every Jenga rule lives in the compiled rulebook, not here: illegal source
layer, one hand at a time, finish a layer before starting the next, and legal
replacement slots are all preconditions in the spec (plan 4.3), evaluated by
the engine's generic loop. That is the tier-3 result -- the *spec format* is
general, not just the weights -- so a rule implemented in this file would
quietly undo it.

What is left is the two things a rulebook cannot state: pairing the halves of a
move into one judgeable event, and phrasing a violation in terms of the slots
actually involved.
