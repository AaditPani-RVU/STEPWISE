"""The checker (FR-CHK-1, FR-CHK-2, FR-CHK-7, FR-CHK-11, FR-CHK-12).

The engine judges events against a lowered spec and nothing else. It does not
know whether the procedure is LEGO or Jenga, ordered or unordered: `spec.lower()`
hands it one list of `LoweredAction`, and every judgement it makes comes out of
the same loop over that action's preconditions. This is FR-CHK-2 cashed in, and
it is the design claim the report makes.

Two things the engine deliberately does not do:

*Simulate.* A spec's `effects` are recorded, never applied. The world state is
whatever the cameras last confirmed (see `state/base.py`), so the only effect an
event has here is on step *status*.

*Guess.* When a precondition cannot be evaluated, or a hard dependency looks
unmet, the engine declines to decide rather than alerting. An alert is a claim
about the user, and we do not make one from a failure of our own (FR-CHK-7).
