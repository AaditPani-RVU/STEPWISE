"""Matching and alert text for the stud grid (FR-CHK-3..6).

The error taxonomy of plan 2.6, made precise enough to implement:

    a pending step wants this cell, part differs   -> wrong brick    (FR-CHK-5)
    a pending step wants this cell, only rot differs -> wrong rotation (FR-CHK-6)
    this part is wanted, but somewhere else        -> wrong position  (FR-CHK-6)
    nothing wants it                               -> extra part     (FR-CHK-6)
    a completed step's brick is gone               -> removed part    (FR-CHK-6)

A brick that draws one of the first three is an *attempt* at that step, made
wrongly, and the step goes to `error`. That is what keeps one mistake to one
alert: `error` counts as performed for the steps that depend on it (see
`events.COMPLETED`), so the next step is not also called out of order, and the
session-end sweep does not report the same step a second time as missed. Taking
the wrong brick away withdraws the attempt and reopens the step without comment;
putting the right brick in completes it.

Out-of-order and missed-step are not here: they come from the generic
precondition loop and the session-end sweep in the engine, because they are
properties of the dependency graph rather than of the grid.

Stud geometry itself -- what two poses on a grid mean relative to each other --
lives in `state/lego/grid.py`, so the tracker and the checker cannot disagree
about whether a brick is where a step wanted it.
