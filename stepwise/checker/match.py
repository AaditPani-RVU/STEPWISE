"""How events are matched to actions, and what an unmatched event means.

The engine is procedure-agnostic (FR-CHK-2), but *matching* cannot be: pairing a
placement with a step needs a part vocabulary and a stud grid, and Jenga has
neither. Rather than branch inside the engine, the state-model-specific part is
isolated behind this protocol and selected from the spec's own `state_model`
field. Adding a state model means adding a policy and a `WorldState`; the engine
is untouched (NFR-MNT-2).
