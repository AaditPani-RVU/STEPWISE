"""The event and alert vocabulary shared by the state trackers and the checker.

Plan section 4.4 sketches an event as a dict. It is a frozen dataclass here for
one reason: the checker binds event fields straight into precondition
expressions (`src.layer`, `hands_in_contact`), and a typo in a dict key would
surface as an unbound name at event time instead of a load-time error.

State trackers produce these (FR-STA-4, FR-STA-8); the checker consumes them
(FR-CHK-1). Nothing here knows which procedure is running.
