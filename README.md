## ✨ What it does

Someone plays **Jenga** or builds a **jigsaw** in front of a camera. STEPWISE follows along and
flags the moment they break the procedure:

| 🚫 Alert | Example |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Illegal move** | Pulling a block from the top complete layer |
| **Out of order** | Filling the middle before the border is done |
| **Missed step** | Finishing with a gap nobody filled |
| **Wrong part** | Putting in a piece that belongs somewhere else |
| **Wrong position / rotation** | Right piece, wrong spot or turned the wrong way |

You don't write any rules by hand. Give it the **manual or rulebook as text**, and an LLM turns
it into the rules the checker enforces.

## 💡 How it works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 📖 Read
**LLM compiler**, offline, once per procedure

Turns the manual into a *procedure spec*: what must be true before each move, and what the move
should change.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 👁️ Watch
**Computer vision**, every frame

Tracks hands and parts and keeps a live *world state*: which Jenga slots are full, which jigsaw
cells are filled.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### ⚖️ Judge
**Deterministic checker**

Compares what the camera sees against the spec. Every alert comes from an explicit rule, never
from the LLM.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> **The LLM never sees video.** It only reads text: it compiles the manual, and later explains
> the session. All visual judgement is made by CV models, and every alert can be traced back to
> the rule that raised it.

## 🎯 Procedures

| | Procedure | Status | Why it's a good test |
| :-: | :-- | :-: | :-- |
| 🟫 | **Jenga** | 🟢 Active | **No step order, only rules.** Tests whether the system handles constraints, not just sequences. All blocks look alike, so any failure is a reasoning failure, not a detection one. |
| 🧩 | **Jigsaw** | 🟢 Active | **A grid of pieces.** Pieces are identified by matching against the box picture, so no training is needed. Its instructions are written as ordered steps (corners → edges → interior). |
| 🧱 | **LEGO** | ⏸️ Parked | The original demo. Code and tests are kept; set aside for now. |

### 📷 Hardware

- **Jenga:** an iPhone Pro with **LiDAR** at one corner of the tower (colour + depth), plus a
  second camera at the opposite corner. Depth makes empty and pushed-out slots easy to see even
  though every block is the same colour.
- **Jigsaw:** one overhead **webcam** above a board with printed ArUco markers at the corners.

<summary><b>🔍 Design details</b></summary>

<br>

**One checker for every procedure.** The world state is an interface (`state/base.py`) with one
implementation per procedure. The checker never asks which one it has, so adding a new procedure
means writing a state tracker. The checker and compiler stay the same.

**Two kinds of spec:**

| Form | For | Looks like |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `DagSpec` | Ordered procedures (jigsaw steps, LEGO) | Steps with parts, poses and dependencies |
| `ConstraintSpec` | Rule-based procedures (Jenga) | Actions with preconditions on the current state |

Both are lowered to the same list of actions with preconditions, so the checker has a single
code path.

**Safe rules.** Preconditions are small expressions like `src.layer < top_layer`. They're checked
against a whitelist when the spec is compiled and evaluated by an AST walker. There is no
`eval` anywhere.

**No guessing.** When the camera can't see enough to judge a move, the checker waits for a
clearer view instead of raising an alert. An alert is a claim about the user, so it never comes
from a failure of our own.

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## 🚀 Quick start

**1. Install** (Python 3.11+)

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"      # core + tests
```

<details>
<summary>Optional extras</summary>

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[live]"     # camera path: torch, ultralytics, mediapipe
uv pip install -e ".[llm]"      # LLM compiler: anthropic SDK
./scripts/fetch_models.sh       # MediaPipe hand model → models/
```

</details>

**2. Run the tests**, no hardware needed

```bash
pytest
```

**3. Replay a Jenga game** through the real tracker and checker

```bash
python -m stepwise.replay scripts/scenarios/jenga_fouls.yaml
```
```text
jenga_game: 6 moves judged, 6 alerts, 0 warnings
  ended: game_over
```

**4. Compile a manual into a spec**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
python -m stepwise.compiler.compile manuals/model_a.txt --kind dag -o specs/model_a.compiled.json
```

> [!TIP]
> Scenario scripts describe the *scene* over time (what's on the table, where the hands are),
> not the events, so the replay exercises the same code a live camera does. Generate one per
> planted error with `scripts/make_scenarios.py`.

<details>
<summary><b>🧱 LEGO live camera (parked)</b></summary>

```bash
python scripts/make_markers.py markers.png       # print at 100%, tape at the plate corners
python -m stepwise.live --spec specs/model_a.json --zero-shot
python -m stepwise.live --spec specs/model_a.json --zero-shot --video run.mp4 --no-show --log run.json
```
